# React ‚öõ‚ö° 
The purpose of this repo is to document my progress of React. So far I have taken two Udemy courses:
 - **'React Front To Back'**, one of the highest rated Udemy course about the React JS framework, instructed by Traversy Media.
  
  Topics covered:
  - Master React Concepts - Components, State, Props, etc
  - Learn & Use The Context API
  - Learn Redux From Scratch
  - Build & Deploy a Client Management App With React, Redux & Firebase/Firestore
  - Master ES6+ Features Like Arrow Functions, Spread & Async Await

 - **'Complete React Developer in 2019'**, a modernised course tackling large scale React development. (üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüèó WIP üöß)
