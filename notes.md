# React
  Client side JS library. Created and maintained by FB (best developers behind it). Used to build front-end applications and user interfaces.

  Often called the V in MVC. Model deals with the data, Controller deals with getting the data from the data and sending it to the view, View is responsible for displaying it to the user.

  Complete organisation of your user interfaces through components, giving them state data and properties rather than just rendering. Makes it more scalable, efficient, and light weight.

# Virtual DOM
  Used to dynamically update parts of the DOM/webpage without reloading the page; you can re-paint it. React simplifies that which you could do with JS.

# React is a *library*
  React should be classified as a library as opposed because it lacks what most frameworks include; a router. Angular and ember have this at their core. Whereas React gets this by using React Router, installed by NPM.
